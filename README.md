# Justo Chess

A personal project that I undertook to keep sharpen my React skills and discover what it takes algorithmically to "play" on a chess board represented by a matrix. Live play with websockets and a Flask + PostgreSQL back end.

## Get Playing

[Visit the Site!](https://justochess.onrender.com/)

If you haven't played before, just hit "New Match" on the home page and click the [copy] button at the top right corner of the match screen.
Once you've got your code, send it over to a friend, who can use the code they've received to join your match.
